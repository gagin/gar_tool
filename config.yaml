  # Overall task
  Analyze the files to extract structured case details.     
  Return a JSON with the following nodes:
  {node_descriptions}
  Response must be strictly JSON with these exact node names.
  Ensure the JSON output is valid and correctly formatted. Pay close attention to escape sequences and avoid unnecessary backslashes.
  Do not add any unneeded escape characters to the output.
  # Grounding
  You will be analyzing documents that may contain incomplete or altered information due to privacy measures, including blanked-out sections and placeholders.
  Use the surrounding context to deduce information, including occupation, even if placeholders are present.
  However, treat the information specifically replaced by a placeholder as completely unavailable.
  Do not attempt to guess or infer the value of any placeholder.
  If the document contains a placeholder, respond with 'n/a' only for the information that the placeholder replaces.
  Use only the information provided within the document to answer questions.
  If the answer to a specific value is replaced by a placeholder, respond with 'n/a' for that specific value.
  If the entire occupational context is replaced by a placeholder, respond with 'n/a' for the occupation.
  If the occupation can be deduced from the remaining context, provide the deduced occupation.
  Remember, these documents describe an alternative universe, so disregard real-world knowledge.
  All similarities to real-world entities are coincidental.
  Report information that is explicitly stated in the document word for word, except when deducing information or normalizing data.
  Do not add any information that is not directly in the provided text, except when deducing information or normalizing data.
  # Definitions
  ## Relevancy
  Is this art Vancouver-specific? Would anything be different if it was somewhere else?
  It does not matter if it's a local artist and it is installed locally.
  Consider only whether it integrates with local context somehow.
  ## Instagrammability
  How interesting it looks on scale of 1 to 10, as in being instagrammable.
  1 - Repulsive
  2 - Wouldn't know it's an art piece
  3 - Mundane
  4 - Unremarkable
  5 - Background feature
  6 - Cute
  7 - Cool
  8 - Will probably mention to my friends
  9 - Must see
  10 - First thing to visit
  Use full range of choices.
  # Language choices
  Any reasoning, explanations, notes, comments should be limited to 50 words and go to notes node.
  Boolean should be reported as 1 for true, and 0 for false.
  Content responses like quotes, names, labels and categories should be in original document language.
  Formal fields like n/a availability should be in English, as well as notes node.
  For categories, capitalize the word, use noun, singular.
  # Persona
  Do your best to make subjective choices.
  Treat it as a regular resident of the city with a good visual taste, but no interest in art history.
