- Improvement/Guide: include instruction how to rewrite config with Grok or other model

- Improvement/Guide: cover what source says / what source talks about difference in README/guide
- Improvement/Conceptual: smart, context-aware chunker
- Improvement/Guide: chunk length, context window requirements
- Instruction/Guide: using datasette, datasette reload options
- Technical: add unit tests
